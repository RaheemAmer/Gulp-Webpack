                        <ul>
                            <li>Robin McLaurin Williams was born at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on July 21, 1951.</li>
                            <li>His father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams, was a senior executive in Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division.</li>
                            <li>His mother, Laurie McLaurin, was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi, whose great-grandfather was Mississippi senator and governor Anselm J. McLaurin, a Democrat.</li>
                            <li>Williams had two elder half-brothers: paternal half-brother Robert (also known as Todd) and maternal half-brother McLaurin.</li>
                            <li>While his mother was a practitioner of Christian Science, Williams was raised in his father's Episcopal faith.</li>
                            <li>During a television interview on Inside the Actors Studio in 2001, Williams credited his mother as an important early influence on his humor, and he tried to make her laugh to gain attention.</li>
                            <li>Williams attended public elementary school in Lake Forest at Gorton Elementary School and middle school at Deer Path Junior High School.</li>
                            <li>He described himself as a quiet child who did not overcome his shyness until he became involved with his high school drama department.</li>
                            <li>In late 1963, when Williams was 12, his father was transferred to Detroit. The family lived in a 40-room farmhouse on 20 acres in suburban Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he was a student at the private Detroit Country Day
                                School. He excelled in school, where he was on the school's wrestling team and was elected class president.</li>
                            <li>In 1973, Williams attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School (Group 6, 1973–1976) in New York City. He was one of 20 students accepted into the freshman class, and he and Christopher Reeve were the only two accepted
                                by John Houseman into the Advanced Program at the school that year.</li>
                            <li>During the summers of 1974, 1975, and 1976, Williams worked as a busboy at The Trident in Sausalito, California. He left Juilliard during his junior year in 1976 at the suggestion of Houseman, who said there was nothing more
                                Juilliard could teach him. Gerald Freedman, another of his teachers at Juilliard, said Williams was a "genius" and that the school's conservative and classical style of training did not suit him; no one was surprised that
                                he left.
                            </li>
                            <li>Williams began performing stand-up comedy in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1976. He gave his first performance at the Holy City Zoo, a comedy club in San Francisco, where he worked his way up from tending bar. In the 1960s,
                                San Francisco was a center for a rock music renaissance, hippies, drugs, and a sexual revolution, and in the late 1970s, Williams helped lead its "comedy renaissance", writes critic Gerald Nachman.</li>
                            <li>Williams says he found out about "drugs and happiness" during that period, adding that he saw "the best brains of my time turned to mud".</li>

                            <li>Williams moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs including The Comedy Store. There, in 1977, he was seen by TV producer George Schlatter, who asked him to appear on a revival of his show Laugh-In. The
                                show aired in late 1977 and was his debut TV appearance.</li>
                            <li>Williams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career. He further said that he neither drank nor took drugs while on stage, but occasionally performed when
                                hung over from the previous day. During the period he was using cocaine, he said it made him paranoid when performing on stage.</li>
                            <li>Mork became popular, featured on posters, coloring books, lunch-boxes, and other merchandise. Mork & Mindy was such a success in its first season that Williams appeared on the March 12, 1979, cover of Time magazine. The cover
                                photo, taken by Michael Dressler in 1979, is said to have captured his different sides: the funnyman mugging for the camera, and a sweet, more thoughtful pose that appears on a small TV he holds in his hands" according
                                to Mary Forgione of the Los Angeles Times. This photo was installed in the National Portrait Gallery in the Smithsonian Institution shortly after his death to allow visitors to pay their respects.</li>
                            <li>Starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, including three HBO comedy specials, Off the Wall (1978), An Evening with Robin Williams (1983), and A
                                Night at the Met (1986). In 1986, Williams co-hosted the 58th Academy Awards. Williams was also a regular guest on various talk shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman,
                                on which he appeared 50 times.</li>
                            <li>Although Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he later became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. He was considered a "national treasure" by many in the entertainment
                                industry and by the public.</li>
                            <li>His on-stage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about
                                drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression. According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, "probably the most important contribution he made to
                                pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person.</li>
                            <li>Throughout the course of his career Williams won numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Good Will Hunting (1997). He also won six Golden Globe Awards, including Best Actor—Motion
                                Picture Musical or Comedy for his roles in Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), The Fisher King (1991) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), along with the Special Golden Globe Award for Vocal Work in a Motion Picture for his role Genie
                                in Aladdin (1992), and the Cecil B. DeMille award in 2005. He also received two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and five Grammy Awards.</li>
